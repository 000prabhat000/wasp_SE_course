## Very basic demo of git functionality

### Positive example of basics

1. Check out the course git repo (git clone git@github.com:robertfeldt/wasp_SE_course.git)
2. Check log of commits and when/which files have changed (git log, git log --stat)
3. Add a link to a new tool/resource (edit README.md to add link to the R linter lintR)
4. Check status of repo (git status)
5. Check differences (git diff)
6. Add change locally (git add <file>)
7. Check status again (git status)
8. Commit the "staged" changes (git commit -m "message")
9. Push changes to origin repo (git push)

### Negative example of basics

As above, and in parallel for step 1, but we also add the R lintr but using the wrong URL.
